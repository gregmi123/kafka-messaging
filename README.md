# kafka-messaging

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform where producers publish messages to topics, and consumers subscribe to those topics to process the incoming data. A Kafka producer is responsible for sending data to Kafka brokers, optionally using keys to control partitioning, while a Kafka consumer reads and processes this data by subscribing to one or more topics, often as part of a consumer group to enable load balancing and fault tolerance. Both producers and consumers rely on serialization and deserialization mechanisms to convert data to and from byte format, and they use configurations such as broker addresses, topic names, and group IDs to interact with the Kafka cluster effectively. This decoupled architecture allows for scalable, real-time data pipelines and event-driven applications.
